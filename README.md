## Project Descriptions 📝

### Instagram Automation 📸💻

- **Description:** The "Instagram Automation" project aims to simplify the interactions with my Instagram profiles by leveraging the instagrapi Python library. With this framework, users can automate various tasks such as liking posts, following/unfollowing users, posting content, and more. This is a flexible and powerful tool for managing all my Instagram accounts programmatically.

- **Set up:**
  - Download and install the latest version of Python from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  - Install the Instagrapi framework by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:
    ```
    pip install Instagrapi
    ```
  - Install the Schedule library by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:
    ```
    pip install schedule
    ```
  - Edit the `credentials.txt` file with your Instagram username and password.
  - Add the path to the video you want to publish and optionally set your own time schedule for automation.
  
  **DONE**

  Note: The Schedule library uses the local timezone of the system where it is running.

- **Possible Improvements:**
  - One potential improvement for this project is to deploy the automation script on an online web machine, allowing it to run 24/7 without interruptions. By hosting the script on a cloud platform or a dedicated server, users can ensure continuous automation of their Instagram interactions, even when their local machine is offline.
